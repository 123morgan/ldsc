This document describes all new file formats introduced for use with the --sumstats* flags
in the ldsc.py software package.

(2) betaprod

chisq
-----
This file format is used for chi-square statistics or P-values for a single GWAS. Tab-
delimited text, one row per SNP with a header row. The first four columns are the same as
the first four columns of a Plink .bim file: 

Required
(0) CHR -- chromosome
(1) SNP -- SNP identifier (e.g., rs number. Non-unique identifiers, NA's or .'s will 
	result in a ValueError being raised).
(2) CM -- genetic position (centimorgans). Set to zero by default. 
(3) BP -- physical position (base pairs).
(4) CHISQ or P -- GWAS summary statistic. ldsc.py will automatically convert P-values to
	chi-square statistics. The advantage of using chi-square statistics is that many 
	statistical software packages have limited ability to deal with very low p-values (e.g.,
	will report all P-values less than 10e-303 as 0, which will result in ldsc.py raising
	a ValueError).
(5) N -- sample size (which may vary from SNP to SNP).

Optional
(6) INFO -- imputation quality (for use with the --info-min and --info-max flags)
(7) MAF -- study minor allele frequency (for use with the --maf flag. ldsc.py will 
	automatically convert frequencies in [0,1] to minor allele frequencies in [0,0.5])


betaprod
--------
This file format is used for summary statistics for two GWAS for genetic covariance 
estimation. Tab-delimited text, one row per SNP with a header row. The first four columns 
are the same as in a plink .bim file: 

Required
(0) CHR -- chromosome
(1) SNP -- SNP identifier (e.g., rs number. Non-unique identifiers, NA's or .'s will 
	result in a ValueError being raised).
(2) CM -- genetic position (centimorgans). Set to zero by default. 
(3) BP -- physical position (base pairs).
(4) A1 -- reference allele.
(5) A2 -- non-reference allele.
(6) CHISQ1 or P1 -- GWAS summary statistic for study 1. ldsc.py will automatically convert 
	P-values to signed betahats. The advantage of using chi-square statistics is that many 
	statistical software packages have limited ability to deal with very low p-values (e.g.,
	will report all P-values less than 10e-303 as 0, which will result in ldsc.py raising
	a ValueError).
(7) DIR1 -- direction of effect of allele A1 for study 1, either 1 or -1.
(8) N1 -- sample size in study 1 (which may vary from SNP to SNP).
(9) CHISQ2 or P2 -- GWAS summary statistic for study 2.
(10) DIR2 -- direction of effect of allele A1 for study 2, either 1 or -1.
(11) N2 -- sample size in study 2 (which may vary from SNP to SNP).

Optional
(12) INFO1 -- imputation quality in study 1 (for use with the --info-min and --info-max flags)
(13) INFO2 -- imputation quality in study 2.
(14) MAF1 -- study 1 minor allele frequency (for use with the --maf flag. ldsc.py will 
	automatically convert frequencies in [0,1] to minor allele frequencies in [0,0.5])
(15) MAF2 -- study 2 minor allele frequency.
