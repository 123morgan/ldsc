This document describes all new file formats introduced for use with the --sumstats* flags
in the ldsc.py software package.

*NOTE* chromosomes are assumed to be integers. This software does not yet deal with sex
chromosomes.

*NOTE* gzip your chisq / allele files

(1) chisq
---------
This file format is used for chi-square statistics or P-values for a single GWAS. Tab-
delimited text, one row per SNP with a header row. The first four columns are the same as
the first four columns of a Plink .bim file: 

Required
(0) CHR -- chromosome
(1) SNP -- SNP identifier (e.g., rs number. Non-unique identifiers, NA's or .'s will 
	result in a ValueError being raised).
(2) CM -- genetic position (centimorgans). Set to zero by default. 
(3) BP -- physical position (base pairs).
(4) N -- sample size (which may vary from SNP to SNP).
(5) CHISQ or P -- GWAS summary statistic. ldsc.py will automatically convert P-values to
	chi-square statistics. The advantage of using chi-square statistics is that many 
	statistical software packages have limited ability to deal with very low p-values (e.g.,
	will report all P-values less than 10e-303 as 0, which will result in ldsc.py raising
	a ValueError).

Optional
(6) INFO -- imputation quality (for use with the --info-min and --info-max flags)
(7) MAF -- study minor allele frequency (for use with the --maf flag. ldsc.py will 
	automatically convert frequencies in [0,1] to minor allele frequencies in [0,0.5])


(2) allele
-----------

Required
(1) SNP
(2) INC_ALLELE -- trait increasing allele (for QT) OR risk allele
